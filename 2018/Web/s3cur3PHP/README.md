### Chall Solution
On the landing page is a base64 encoded message, which on decoding gives a python commnand which on running gives "send get request using viewsource parameter". On using the viewsource parameter, we are able to view the PHP Code. And then there are a few checks to bypass. The final URL for the flag is:

```
http://35.154.254.85/s3cur3PHP/?viewsource&flag[]&secret=1729aaaaaaaaa
```

The flag is there in the source code.
