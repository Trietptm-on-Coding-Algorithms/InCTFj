**Description**: Can you crack these Strong numbers ? 

**Flag**: inctfj{Its_a_3_D1g1t_Armstr0ng_numb3r}

**Walk-through**: On analysing the binary, it can be interpreted that the code first finds cube of each digit and adds them. If the result is equal to the input number the flag is displayed, else its not a valid input. 
Hence, its a three digit Armstrong number.
